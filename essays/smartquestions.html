  <p>It’s important to find a forum that’s appropriate for your topic. You can use tools like Google to help with your search. However, don’t solely rely on the name of the forum, newsgroup, or mailing list. Look for a FAQ or charter to ensure your question is relevant. It’s also a good idea to review previous discussions before posting so you can get a sense of the forum’s culture. Generally, public forums are better places to ask questions than private ones. This is because there are more potential respondents and a larger audience. Hackers are more likely to answer questions that benefit many people rather than just a few.</p>

<p>When looking for answers to technical and other questions, Stack Overflow is a valuable resource that many open-source projects prefer. However, it is recommended to start with a Google search first as it indexes in real-time. This increases the chances of finding similar questions that have already been asked, and Stack Exchange sites often appear at the top of the search results. Super User is the go-to forum for general-purpose computing questions. If your question is not related to code or programs that you interact with only over a network connection, it is likely to be answered here. For programming questions, Stack Overflow is the best option, while Server Fault is the ideal platform for server and network administration queries. Several projects have their own particular sites, such as Android, Ubuntu, TeX/LaTeX, and SharePoint. For an up-to-date list, check the Stack Exchange site.</p>

<p>If you are a newbie and need help with Linux, check out your local user group or your distribution’s Web forum or IRC channel. These are great places to start, especially for common or simple problems. When asking for help, make sure to use a subject header that is clear and concise, with the object specifying the thing or group having the problem and the deviation describing the unexpected behavior. Be specific in describing your problem, including the symptoms, environment, research you’ve done, diagnostic steps taken, recent changes, and if possible, provide a way to reproduce the issue. When asking for help with code, provide a minimal bug-demonstrating test case. Remember to describe what you did leading up to the problem and what the machine and software did before the issue occurred. Avoid asking for help without giving any indication of what the problem might be.</p>

<p>Here is a example of a stupit question found in stack over flow:</p>

<p>##Understanding the difference beetween calling and Invoking function in JavaScript
I’m currently working on a project in js, and i’ve come across a concept that’s been causing me some confusion: the diference between calling and involke. I’ve read the documentation and various tutorials, but I’m still struggling to grasp the distinction and how it applies to my code.
So What is the fundamental difference between calling and invoking functions in js How do these concepts relate to the code I’ve provided? 
Are there specific examples or scenarios where understanding this distinction is crucial for my project?.</p>

<p>It’s perfectly fine to ask for clarification. However, in this particular case, it seems like the person who asked the question didn’t provide enough evidence of the research they’ve conducted. It would have been helpful if they had shared the specific concept they found confusing, along with the documentation they consulted to ensure the information they received was reliable and accurate.</p>
